**A simple API to make 2D game development easier and GUI creation more controllable with Java ☕️**


If you want to test this API first, you can just download the binaries ("bin"-folder) and run the Main.class file.
It will give you a look through all the features which are available currently.
Don't get too frustrated by the old graphics as you can actually overwrite the whole design easily.
Currently, the focus of the development goes on solidity and stability before anything else.


# First Impression
![Application sample](https://i.ibb.co/qdhZN4J/preview.png)


# Uses of GUInness
- for development of simple 2D games
- for fast creation of GUI environments
- for highly modifiable GUIs
- as a lightweight alternative to the Swing library


# General Features
- capable of multi-threading
- viewport movement & scaling**¹**
- all components are organized in "layers"**²**
- all components have actions defined
- easy error-tracking (logs, advices and brief comments)

**¹**especially for creating maps, games or browser-related content

**²**comparable to CSS with "z-index" property.


# Featured Components (ready-to-use)
- text descriptions
- buttons (rectangle button / default)
- polygon buttons (a special and dynamic shape button)
- text-fields
- check-boxes
- selection-boxes (using radio buttons)
- images / pictures
- rectangles


# Planed Features
- add paths
- add hyper-links for referring to webpages
- add simple background sound tracks
- add video components
- add ability for LOD levels depending on the current Viewport scale**¹**

**¹**especially for creating maps, games or browser-related content


# Documentation
Will follow at the final release.
Anyway, you can find brief comments in the code yet but I know it's a dirty compilation still..


# Motivation for development
GUInness was originally written first because I wanted to build a solid structure in order
to build 2D games more easily.
At all I want to build a simple strategy game which probably lacks of graphics but is rich in terms of features.
I could have used available game engines from the web but my plan was it to build everything up from scratch,
so that's the challenge for me.


# Stats / Nice To Know (as of Sep 12 2020)

# Donations (via LiteCoin)
I do this in my free-time so any donation would be highly appreciated;
especially in the mind of open-source it is more about the attention someone gives me rather than the amount.
