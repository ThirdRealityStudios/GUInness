# Discontinued project
**Unfortunately I do not have enough time to improve the API**
**Also, a porting to Open GL was planned but due to my study I have to abort this project**


#
#


**A Swing-based API to enable the development of basic GUI environments and games**


#


# First Impression
![Application sample](https://i.ibb.co/pfdXF2L/Preview.png)


# Uses of GUInness
- for development of simple 2D games
- for fast creation of GUI environments (in terms of usability)
- for highly modifiable GUIs
- as a lightweight alternative to the native Java GUI libraries


# General Features
- capable of multi-threading
- viewport movement & scaling**¹**
- all components are organized in "layers"**²**
- all components have actions defined
- easy error-tracking (logs, advices and brief comments)

**¹**especially for creating maps, games or browser-related content

**²**comparable to CSS with "z-index" property.


# Featured Components (ready-to-use)
- descriptions
- buttons (rectangle button / default)
- polygon buttons (a special and dynamic shape button)
- text-fields
- check-boxes
- selection-boxes (using radio buttons)
- images
- rectangles (border thickness, radius etc.)
- simulated windows for implementing multiple Viewports within one display**¹**

**¹**useful for making menus, grouping components etc. (see picture above)


# Planed Features
- add paths
- add hyper-links for referring to webpages
- add simple background sound tracks
- add video components
- add ability for LOD levels depending on the current Viewport scale**¹**

**¹**especially for creating maps, games or browser-related content


# How to run / binaries
If you want to test this API first, you can just download the binaries ("bin"-folder) and run the Main.class file in package "org.thirdreality.guinness.sample".
It will give you a rough look through all the features which are available currently.


# Documentation
Will follow at the final release.
Anyway, you can find brief comments in the code yet but I know it's a dirty compilation still..


# Motivation for development
GUInness was originally written first because I wanted to build a solid structure in order
to build 2D games more easily.
At all I want to build a simple strategy game which probably lacks of graphics but is rich in terms of features.
I could have used available game engines from the web but my plan was it to build everything up from scratch,
so that's the challenge for me.


# Stats / Nice To Know (as of 11/15/2020)
- total lines of code: 4848 (counted them with "[cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)")
- code size: 200.5 kB


# Already having used GUInness?
Maybe you want to fill in a little survey just shortly for what you are using GUInness actually for:

# Donations (via LiteCoin)
I do this in my free-time so any donation would be highly appreciated;
especially in the mind of open-source it is more about the attention someone gives me rather than the amount.
